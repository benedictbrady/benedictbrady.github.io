      <h1 class="title">Predictions for 2026</h1>
      <p class="subtitle" style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;">I hold positions in some assets and companies mentioned here. If you are building anything related to one of these ideas I would love to chat about angel investing.</p>

      <div id="l1s">
        <h1>L1s</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>The quantum narrative becomes a serious headwind for Bitcoin in 2026 and the community is too decentralized to put forward a credible plan.</li>
          <li>Ethereum continues its multi-year decline in mindshare and it begins to show up in material underperformance.</li>
          <li>Solana continues its transition away from memecoin chain and becomes the dominant place for real world synthetic assets to trade. It continues to have the largest retail footprint by user count.</li>
          <li>Monad finds its footing and becomes a relevant L1, finishing the year well above the Coinbase ICO price. None of the other execution layers launched in 2025 or early 2026 gain any durable traction or mindshare.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div id="applications">
        <h1>Applications</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Hyperliquid gains marketshare among crypto-native perps platforms but it turns out the market for BTC/ETH/Alt perps isn't growing very fast.</li>
          <li>Prediction markets fail to meaningfully grow beyond sports and major political events and as such slowly fade into the background.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div id="infra">
        <h1>Infra</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>The Robinhood L2 goes nowhere because there is less of a need for the reg arb benefits in this political environment.</li>
          <li>Base gives up being an L2.</li>
          <li>Some privacy middleware that sits below applications and vertically integrates with embedded wallets becomes quite popular.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div id="ai-crypto">
        <h1>AI (Crypto)</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>AI assistants get capable enough to become a default offering inside of most major consumer apps. By the end of the year a major point of differentiation between different apps becomes the quality of the assistant.</li>
          <li>Multiple smart contracts gain significant traction that were written and tested almost entirely by Claude. The barrier to writing a smart contract feels 10x lower in 12 months than it feels right now which leads to a mechanism designer renaissance.</li>
          <li>ChatGPT becomes more modular and agentic with plugins and a crypto use case goes viral inside of ChatGPT.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div id="ai-non-crypto">
        <h1>AI (Non-Crypto)</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>OpenAI revenue continues to climb to 40-50B but by the end of the year it is neck and neck with Anthropic raising some complicated questions for their business.</li>
          <li>Google figures out post training and Gemini Flash becomes the most popular model in the world for non coding agentic tasks.</li>
          <li>Almost every AI company that sells to enterprise realizes that it is competing with every other company and this collapse of the substrate leads to a lot sharper elbows.</li>
          <li><em>(Longshot but I think underpriced relative to consensus)</em> A new paradigm emerges beyond "give an LLM a detailed prompt and a series of specialized tools" and this change dramatically shakes up which start ups in the space are valuable.</li>
        </ul>
