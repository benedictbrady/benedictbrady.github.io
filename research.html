        <h1>The Motivation</h1>
        <p>Over the past few years, I have documented, reverse-engineered, and helped design a series of primitives that have meaningfully altered the market structure on Solana (Prop AMMs, JIT routing, flow discrimination, and much more).</p>
        <p>However, the job is far from finished. This past month, I have been tinkering around a few areas that I believe are underdeveloped and ripe for meaningful progress.</p>
        <p>I want to bring someone on to the Meridian team to further explore these ideas and build something impactful.</p>

        <h1>The Job</h1>
        <p>I'm looking for one person to join me for one to two months to validate the core thesis. The compensation will be well above market rate with the opportunity to have meaningful upside in whatever comes next.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Location is ideally San Francisco but will consider candidates in New York</li>
          <li>Experience with quant trading and Solana market structure is mandatory</li>
          <li>Understanding of AI systems is mandatory (e.g. can explain how Claude Code works)</li>
          <li>Competent in Python, ideally with some Rust experience</li>
          <li>This will be fast-paced and very demanding</li>
        </ul>
        To apply, please email your best solution to the problem below to benedict [at] mrdn dot ai.

      <div id="problem">
        <h1>The Application</h1>
        <p>Uniswap V3 was designed to allow concentrated liquidity on AMMs. This protocol manifests differently on L2s vs. the L1 due to gas costs and ordering properties.</p>
        <p>You are given $100k ETH and $100k USDC and asked to design a market making strategy for Uniswap V3 on a FIFO L2 with a fixed cost of 1c to update a position. Email me a high level outline for the best profit maximizing strategy you can come up with.</p>
